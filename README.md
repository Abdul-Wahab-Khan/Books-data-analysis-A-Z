# Books-data-analysis-A-Z
This repository has a project based on scraping data from web, cleaning it, analysing it and finally visualizing different insights
This project will get you through all of the steps from data scraping to visualizing the data, which of all steps are how I did with my own way, so if you found any mistake feel free to share, I am keen to learn from you

You can use the jupyter notebook and extract the dataset your self but if you wanted to get only the data set, its available in this repo also in kaggle from the link below
